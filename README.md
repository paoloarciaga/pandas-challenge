To fulfill the requirements of this Pandas Challenge, I applied the skills acquired from class to develop my initial code. Additionally, I consulted my tutor for further assistance, aming to troubleshoot my code and verify the functionality of it. My tutor was able to help me with the following parts of my code:
1. Using the ‘pd.cut’ function to categorize spending into bins
2. Editing my code to fix my school-size dataframe, as my initial code incorrectly categorized every school as small.
   
The following files can be found in the ‘PyCitySchools’ folder of this repo:
1. The Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) where I practiced my code
2. My final Python file (.py)
3. My written report (.docx), summarizing my analysis
