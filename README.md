# Pandas-Challenge

In order to analyze the district-wide standardized test results, I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attended. I aggregated the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance by using Pandas. 

I created a report that includes the following data organized into DataFrames: 
- District Summary
- School Summary
- Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
- Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)
- Math Scores by Grade
- Reading Scores by Grade
- Scores by School Spending

To fulfill the requirements of this Pandas Challenge, I applied the skills acquired from class to develop my initial code. Additionally, I consulted my tutor for further assistance, aming to troubleshoot my code and verify the functionality of it. My tutor was able to help me with the following parts of my code:
1. Using the ‘pd.cut’ function to categorize spending into bins
2. Editing my code to fix my school-size dataframe, as my initial code incorrectly categorized every school as small.
   
The following files can be found in the ‘PyCitySchools’ folder of this repo:
1. The Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) where I practiced my code
2. My final Python file (.py)
3. My written report (.docx), summarizing my analysis

Within the ‘Resources’ folder of this repo, you will find both csv files that I ultimately stored into Pandas DataFrames and merged into a single dataset in order to conduct my analysis.
